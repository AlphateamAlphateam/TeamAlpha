        <h2>Measure and Watch Your Weight</h2>
        <p>Keeping track of your body weight on a daily or weekly basis will help you see what you’re losing and/or what 
          you’re gaining</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>Limit Unhealthy Foods and Eat Healthy Meals</h2>
        <p>Do not forget to eat breakfast and choose a nutritious meal with more protein and fiber and less fat, sugar, and 
          calories. </p>
      </div>

        <h2>Take Multivitamin Supplements</h2>
        <p>To make sure you have sufficient levels of nutrients, taking a daily multivitamin supplement is a good idea, 
          especially when you do not have a variety of vegetables and fruits at home. Many micronutrients are vital to your 
          immune system, including vitamins A, B6, B12, C, D, and E, as well as zinc, iron, copper, selenium, and magnesium. 
          However, there’s currently NO available evidence that adding any supplements or “miracle mineral supplements” 
          to your diet will help protect you from the virus or increase recovery. In some cases, high doses of vitamins can be 
          bad for your health. </p>

          <h2>Drink Water and Stay Hydrated, and Limit Sugared Beverages</h2>
          <p>Drink water regularly to stay healthy, but there is NO evidence that drinking water frequently (e.g. every 15 
            minutes) can help prevent any viral infection. </p>

          <h2>Exercise Regularly and Be Physically Active</h2>
          <p>At this time, at-home workouts may be a good idea. But you can also walk your dog or run outside. Be sure you 
            know what’s going on in your area and if there are any restrictions or mandatory self-quarantines.</p>

        <div>
          <h2>Reduce Sitting and Screen Time</h2>
          <p>Exercise can’t immunize you from your sedentary time. Even people who exercise regularly could be at increased 
            risk for diabetes and heart disease and stroke if they spend lots of time sitting behind computers.</p>

          <h2>Get Enough Good Sleep</h2>
          <p>There is a very strong connection between sleep quality and quantity and your immune system. You can keep your 
            immune system functioning properly by getting seven to eight hours of sleep each night.</p>

          <h2> Go Easy on Alcohol and Stay Sober</h2>
          <p>Drinking alcohol does not protect you from the coronavirus infection. Don’t forget that those alcohol calories can 
            add up quickly. Alcohol should always be consumed in moderation.</p>
